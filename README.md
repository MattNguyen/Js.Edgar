Js.Edgar
=======

Lightweight Spy/Mock Library for JavaScript

Why choose this name?
------------------

This library is meant to create, manage, and direct spies for testing JavaScript.  As such, it only seemed natural to name it after one of the most infamous intelligence directors in history, J. Edgar Hoover.
